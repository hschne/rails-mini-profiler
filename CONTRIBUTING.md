## Development

Thanks for considering to help make Rails Mini Profiler better! :raised_hands:

### Setting Up

Create a fork of Rails Mini Profiler and clone it locally. Create a new branch for your change, e.g.

```shell
git checkout -b add-awesome-new-feature
```

Setup RMP locally by executing:

```bash
# Setup Rails
bundle install
rails db:setup

# Install Node and build assets
npm install
npm run build
```

Then code away!

### Testing Local Changes

Rails Mini Profiler is a Rails Engine and can be tested out by mounting it in a 'real' Rails app. The `Dummy` application
is such an app and  resides in `spec/dummy`. 

To manually test your changes simply run `rails server` on the root level of your application. To execute the test suite
run 

```bash
bundle exec rake spec
```

#### Working with Assets

Javascript and CSS are packaged as a separate node module and bundled using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/). 
For continuous compilation and live preview first start your Rails server and then run:

```bash
npm run watch
```

```bash
bundle exec annotate -i --models --exclude tests,fixtures 
```

Speedscope run

```bash
rake speedscope:update
```

#### Appraisals

To locally test against multiple Rails versions use [Appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal):
